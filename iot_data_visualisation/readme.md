# IoT Weather Visualization â€“ HCI Course Project

This project was developed for the **IoT Architecture and Visualization** course at WHZ.

We used **Node-RED**, **InfluxDB**, and **Grafana** to build a weather data visualization system that fetches and compares live weather metrics (temperature, humidity, rainfall, snowfall, wind speed/direction) across five German cities.

- Data source: **Open-Meteo API**
- Data processing: **Node-RED**
- Time-series storage: **InfluxDB**
- Dashboard and visualization: **Grafana**

Topics covered: **Time-series data**, **real-time data flow**, **dashboard design**, **data visualization**, and **IoT integration**.
